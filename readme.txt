Docker itself is an open source platform. it enables developers to build, package and deliver their products
in containers. containers are lightweight and standalone units that deliver application with all its dependencies 
and ensure that it will have a consistent behavior across different environments.

Docker is an ideal way to deliver your application, no matter where you want to run it the setup, the configuration, 
the environment, everything will be handled by Docker.
Whenever you deploy your application to any kind of new platform. It would be fair to say that this reminds of 
regular VMs.
Docker manages to make its containers lighter than the regular virtual machine, because it does not actually 
require a full operational system to work. it builds on top of an existing operational system and utilizes 
its services and capacity to run its containers, basically providing only the bare minimum for each container
to function.

This means that Docker will be way faster and cheaper to run than regular VM. the speed and resource cost 
efficiency of Docker made it quite popular in the industry. 
as well as its capacity to well integrate itself into CI, CD workflows and processes, capacity to deliver 
stable and predictable behavior of applications in both test and production environments, as well as the 
sprawling community that supports the platform. Multiple images and contributes to its further development.
